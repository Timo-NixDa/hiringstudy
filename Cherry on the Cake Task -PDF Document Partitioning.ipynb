    "## PDF Document Partitioning\n",
    "\n",
    "Objective:\n",
    "Implement the `partition_the_pdf_document` function to analyze a PDF file and identify groups of pages that belong together as distinct documents or sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Structure:\n",
    "The function `partition_the_pdf_document` is provided with a basic structure. Your task is to implement the logic within this function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input:\n",
    "- A PDF file path (the function should be able to handle various PDF files)\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "- A dictionary where:\n",
    "  - Keys are strings representing document names (e.g., \"Document 1\", \"Document 2\", etc.)\n",
    "  - Values are lists of integers representing page numbers belonging to each document\n",
    "\n",
    "Task:\n",
    "1. Implement the `partition_the_pdf_document` function:\n",
    "   - Input: A string representing the path to the input PDF file\n",
    "   - Output: A dictionary of document groups as described above\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The function should analyze the content and visual features of the PDF to determine logical groupings of pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements:\n",
    "1. The function must be generalizable to work with different PDF files, not just the example \"grouped_documents.pdf\".\n",
    "2. Implement robust methods to detect various visual features that might distinguish different documents within the PDF, such as:\n",
    "   - Colored borders\n",
    "   - Watermarks\n",
    "   - Colored backgrounds\n",
    "   - Distinctive headers or footers\n",
    "   - Changes in layout or formatting\n",
    "3. Handle potential exceptions or edge cases (e.g., inconsistent formatting, mixed feature types).\n",
    "4. Optimize for both accuracy and processing speed, considering that PDFs can be large and contain many pages.\n",
    "5. You are allowed to use up to 40GB of GPU VRAM if necessary for your implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional Considerations:\n",
    "- You may use additional libraries if needed, but ensure they are imported properly.\n",
    "- You can create additional helper functions as necessary to support your implementation.\n",
    "- Provide clear comments in your code to explain your partitioning logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing:\n",
    "- Test your implementation with various types of PDFs to ensure its robustness and generalizability.\n",
    "- The main script provides a way to test your implementation on a file named \"grouped_documents.pdf\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Note:\n",
    "The example output in the provided code is specific to \"grouped_documents.pdf\". Your implementation should be able to handle different PDFs with varying numbers of documents and pages per document."
